# Number Guessing Game
 A Treehouse Techdegree project for Data Analysis (Project #1)

This game consists of having the user guess the randomized number between 1 and 100
    The user is then informed if the number is higher or lower than their guess they just made

    After the user guesses correctly, their number of attempts is shown, and this data is given from throughout the number of times they've played:
        Average number of attempts 
        Median of attempts
        Most often typed attempt

    Thee user will then be asked if they want to play again.
